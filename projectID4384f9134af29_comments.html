<p><b>NOTES ON PROOFING TAGALOG:</b></p>

<p>TAGALOG is commonly spoken in the Philippines and is the basis for the national language called Pilipino or Filipino. For the non native speaker, it is fairly easy to proof this book, you just need a keen eye for details due to the accents on the vowels.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you have a "cheat sheet" of commonly accented vowels and symbols with you when you are proofing (aren't you just raring to use them?). These are :</p>
   
<p align="center"><big>à  á  ô  è  é  ñ  ì  í  ò  ó  ù  ú  ¡  ¿  «  »</big></p>
  
<p>Old Tagalog also has the tilde (~) on top of g which should be proofed as ~g. You will usually see them as : n~g, n~ga, m~ga.</p>

<p>You might also find words with 2 commas and no spaces e.g pagca,t, or siya,y, or aco,y, this is an old way of writing contractions so please proof as per image.</p>

<p>This work has been OCR-ed without the aid of a spelling dictionary, so expect some more OCR scanning errors than you are likely to encounter in English texts.</p>

<p>Post processing will be done by a native speaker so you dont have to worry about the hyphens if you are not sure whether this is one word or not. If in doubt, leave ** or you can PM me <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/privmsg.php?mode=post&u=24342">here</a> to ask.</p>

<p>An HTML version will be made from this, so please include references to illustrations. Also pls indicate [Illustration] for the ornate first letter of the chapter, this will also be included in the HTML version</p>

<p>If you see any advertisements at the end of the book, just mark them as [Illustration: Advertisement]</p>

<p>Old Tagalog novels are rare so you are doing a great service in preserving these literary creations!</p>

<p>Maraming Salamat po! (Thank you very much!)</p></BODY></HTML>
